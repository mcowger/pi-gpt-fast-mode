# pi-gpt-fast-mode

This is a fork of [@tunnckocore/pi-gpt-fast-mode](https://github.com/tunnckoCore/pi-gpt-fast-mode), created by [Matt Cowger](https://github.com/mcowger). The original implementation and idea belong to [TunnckoCore](https://github.com/tunnckoCore). Thanks for making it available.

Fast mode for supported GPT-5.4 / GPT-5.5 / GPT-5.6 models in Pi - one file, easy to review. No ceremony.

This package adds one command:

```text
/fast
```

Run it once and supported GPT requests get `service_tier: "priority"`.
Run it again and they stop.

Default is off. As it should be.

## What it actually does

Pi already lets you lower reasoning with things like `:low`. That is not the same thing as Codex CLI Fast mode.

Codex Fast mode is a service tier. This extension patches the provider payload before the request leaves Pi:

```json
{
  "service_tier": "priority"
}
```

It only applies when the active model is one of:

```text
gpt-5.4
gpt-5.4-mini
gpt-5.5
gpt-5.6
gpt-5.6-sol
gpt-5.6-terra
gpt-5.6-luna
gpt-6-astra
```

Other model IDs are left alone. No weird surprise bill multiplier on an unsupported model.

## Install

From GitHub:

```bash
pi install git:github.com/mcowger/pi-gpt-fast-mode
```

Try it without installing:

```bash
pi --no-extensions -e git:github.com/mcowger/pi-gpt-fast-mode
```

Or from a local checkout:

```bash
pi -e ./pi-gpt-fast-mode
```

## Use

Inside Pi:

```text
/fast              # toggle the current session
/fast on           # enable the current session
/fast off          # disable the current session
/fast status       # show current and default states
/fast default on   # enable future sessions by default
/fast default off  # disable future sessions by default
/fast-status id    # emit machine-readable status for an adapter
```

Arguments are case-insensitive and extra whitespace is ignored. Invalid forms warn without changing anything.

`/fast-status` sends a JSON notification with the type `pi-gpt-fast-mode.status`, the current session state, model, and model support status. Pass a request ID to correlate the response from an adapter.

## Default state

Fast mode starts off by default. `/fast default on` and `/fast default off` update future sessions only; use `/fast on` or `/fast off` for the current session.

The default commands update the same global settings field you can configure manually:

```json
{
  "pi-gpt-fast-mode": {
    "enabled": true
  }
}
```

Unrelated strict-JSON settings are preserved. Malformed or non-object settings files are left unchanged and reported as errors.

The extension looks for that file in this order:

1. `$PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR/settings.json`
2. `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/pi/agent/settings.json`
3. `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/pi/settings.json`
4. `~/.pi/agent/settings.json`

If `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is unset, it tries `~/.config` for the XDG paths.

## Keybinding setting

The default shortcut is `ctrl+alt+m`, which avoids Pi's built-in defaults.

To change it, add this field to Pi's global keybindings file. The value should be an array:

```json
{
  "pi-gpt-fast-mode": ["ctrl+alt+m"]
}
```

Multiple shortcuts work too:

```json
{
  "pi-gpt-fast-mode": ["ctrl+alt+m", "ctrl+shift+m"]
}
```

Set it to an empty array to disable the shortcut:

```json
{
  "pi-gpt-fast-mode": []
}
```

`ctrl+m`, `enter`, and `return` are ignored because many terminals encode Enter as `ctrl+m`.

The extension looks for that file in this order:

1. `$PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR/keybindings.json`
2. `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/pi/agent/keybindings.json`
3. `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/pi/keybindings.json`
4. `~/.pi/agent/keybindings.json`

If `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is unset, it tries `~/.config` for the XDG paths.

## Caveats

This is a payload patch, not first-class Pi core support.

So yes: it asks Codex for the Fast service tier. But Pi's own pricing display may not perfectly explain the increased usage if the upstream response does not report the tier back clearly.

The request is the part that matters.

## Test

```bash
bun run test
```

The test mocks the Pi extension API and checks the only things worth checking here:

- current-session commands and status work
- defaults are persisted for future sessions without clobbering other settings
- only supported GPT-5.4 / GPT-5.5 / GPT-5.6 / GPT-6 models get patched
- keybinding config is loaded

No fake testing theater. Just enough net under the wire.
